#### My projects:
#### [Auction House <-- click to view live site](https://genuine-squirrel-c1ec8c.netlify.app/)
* An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.
When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use
credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.

#### [TripBlog <-- click to view live site](https://dynamic-twilight-02d190.netlify.app/)
* This is as a cross-curse project. I started to make this project as one among first projects during my study. The project is developed throughout the period of study. The last changes were to create a database on WordPress and use this data in the project. Products are fetched from the WP REST API. Site is built by using HTML, CSS, Java Script. To make a site responsive I used both flexbox and grid. Front-end is written by me - site is Headless CMS.
