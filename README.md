### Something about me:
Hi	:wave: :smiley:! I'm Mariusz Rozycki. <br> 
I'm a student of fifth semester of Front-End Development - I'm studing on Noroff in Norway, but:
* As a front-end developer, I specialize in: Html, CSS, Java Script, React.js <br> 
* I create scalable and modular front-end architectures <br>
* I focus on creating very well looking websites, writing clear and understandable code <br>
* I still improve myself by deep studying of front-end development

I'm looking forward to take a contact with you :grin:
